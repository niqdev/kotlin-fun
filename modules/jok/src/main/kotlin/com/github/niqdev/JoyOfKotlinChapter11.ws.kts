// the Day-Stout-Warren algorithm is a simple method for efficiently balancing binary search trees: it's designed for in-place modifications
// one of the most efficient self-balancing tree designs is the red-black tree:
// - it's a binary search tree with some additions to its structure and a modified insertion algorithm that also balances the result
