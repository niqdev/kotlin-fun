// the `Either` type is useful for functions that can return values of two different types
// the `Result` type is useful when you need a type that represents either data or an error

// sum type: means a type `E<T, U>` will hold either a T OR a U, but not a T and a U
// it's called a sum type because the number of possible different realizations is the sum of the number of possible realizations of T and U
// a product type, such as a Pair<T, U>, for which the number of possible realizations is the product of the number of possible T by the number of possible U
